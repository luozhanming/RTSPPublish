/**
 * Defines the RTP packetizer to stream AVC video slices over a TCP channel.<br>
 * It implements RTP/RTCP over RTSP as defined in RFC 2326, session 10.12.<br>
 * Stream data such as RTP packets is encapsulated by an ASCII dollar
 * sign (24 hexadecimal), followed by a one-byte channel identifier,
 * followed by the length of the encapsulated binary data as a binary,
 * two-byte integer in network byte order. The stream data follows
 * immediately afterwards, without a CRLF, but including the upper-layer
 * protocol headers. Each $ block contains exactly one upper-layer
 * protocol data unit, e.g., one RTP packet.
